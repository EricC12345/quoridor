    -- montana, tylor: MoveServer runs a loop waiting for connections. when 
       a display client connects to it, it starts up its playGame logic.
       with the --display argument passed to it, it will show its own display
       of what's going on so a viewer can watch (or in the case of AI_AskUser, 
       the player can make moves). the problem is that it will start a new 
       GameBoardFrame with each call to playGame. GameBoardFrame will need a
       method or something to close the window when the game ends. please help!
