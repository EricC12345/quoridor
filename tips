add this to your .bashrc or .zshrc :

function gb() {
    pushd . > /dev/null
    cd "$HOME/405/teams/" > /dev/null # you might have to adjust this line
    ./gradlew build "$@"
    popd > /dev/null
}

you can now type gb from any directory to build the project!
also you can pass arguments to gb like this: gb clean
