How to run the game:

    1. Start up a UserServer, give it a port number

                java -cp build/classes/main/ UserServer 1234


    2. Run Game, give it the port-host of at least two other User-
         Servers
                
                java -cp build/classes/main/ Game localhost 1234 \
                localhost 5678


         Note that the \ just means to continue the command onto the
         next line. You do not need to do this.

         You can also start a 4-player game using a similar setup

                java -cp build.classes/main/Game localhost 1234 \
                Whiteface 5678 Gothics 9012 Redfield 3456


    3. Play the game! You have to input moves via the terminal that is
         running the respective UserServer

         An example move for player 0 is V-B (moves down)

         Use the labels printed on the graphic display to guide your
         movements

Gradle Help:

    1. If you have never run gradle, you might have to install it. run:

                ./gradlew


    2. It should say downloading gradle..................
         afterward you can run 

                ./gradlew build 
                ./gradlew clean


         The first builds the whole project (including running any tests),
         the second removes the build.

    3. After you have built the code, run the following:

                java -cp build/libs/quoridorschmoridor.jar Main


         for an example of running a program.
