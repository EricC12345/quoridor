[01] How to run the game:

    1. After running gradle to build the class files, navigate from within
         the teams.git root to:

                ./build/classes/main

    2. Start up at least two UserServers (in different terminals), give
         them unique port numbers

                java UserServer 1234


    3. Run Game in another terminal. Give it the port-host of at least two 
         other UserServers
                
                java Game localhost 1234 localhost 5678


         You can also start a 4-player game using a similar setup

                java Game localhost 1234 Whiteface 5678 \
                          Gothics 9012 Redfield 3456


         Note that the \ just means to continue the command onto the
         next line. You do not need to do this.

    4. Play the game! You have to input moves via the terminal that is
         running the respective UserServer

         An example move for player 0 is V-B (moves down)

         Use the labels printed on the graphic display to guide your
         movements

[02] Gradle Help:

    1. If you have never run gradle, you might have to install it. run:

                ./gradlew


    2. It should say downloading gradle..................
         afterward you can run 

                ./gradlew build 
                ./gradlew clean


         The first builds the whole project (including running any tests),
         the second removes the build.

    3. After you have built the code, run the following:

                java -cp build/libs/quoridorschmoridor.jar Main


         for an example of running a program.

[03] Tips

    1. Easy gradle build function

        add this to your .bashrc or .zshrc :

                function gb() {
                    pushd . > /dev/null
                    # you might have to adjust this line below
                    cd "$HOME/405/teams/" > /dev/null
                    ./gradlew build "$@"
                    popd > /dev/null
                }


        you can now type gb from any directory to build the project!
          also you can pass arguments to gb like this: gb clean

    2. Run class files from anywhere

        this will allow you to run any of your class files for our project
          regardless of what directory you are currently in

                export CLASSPATH="$HOME/teams/build/classes/main$CLASSPATH"
