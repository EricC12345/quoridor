if you have never run gradle, you might have to install it. run:

./gradlew

it should say downloading gradle..................
afterward you can run 

./gradlew build 
./gradlew clean

the first builds the whole project (including running any tests)
the second removes the build.

after you have built the code, run the following:

java -cp build/libs/quoridorschmoridor.jar Main

for an example of running a program.
